 A rule set consists of a selector followed by a declaration block. The declaration tells a browser how to draw an element on a selected page.
While data rules capture an understanding of data quality at the columnar level (as they are executed or associated with one or multiple columns) and provide information about which records meet or do not meet an individual rule, they do not capture how a record within a data source conforms to multiple data rules, for example, how many rules does a specific record break, nor do they identify the overall quality or confidence in a data source. 
Rule sets provide the capability to achieve this broader, more holistic, view of a data source and its records by executing and evaluating multiple rules together against individual records.
